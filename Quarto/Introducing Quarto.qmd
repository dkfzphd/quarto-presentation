# What is Quarto?

-   publishing system
-   lets you combine text, code, and code output
-   output formats: articles, presentations, websites, books, blogs...

Sound familiar? - it's very similar to R Markdown -\> if you know R Markdown, you'll find it easy to switch

We recently did a workshop on R Markdown: https://youtu.be/l12RpPbZJUA

-   but: Quarto is designed to more seamlessly handle different output formats
-   and: Quarto can be used for other programming languages such as Python and Julia
-   ...as well as within other code editors like VS Code
-   it also seems to have some additional features

## Installation

If you want to follow along with my demonstrations/try Quarto for yourself later: - download Quarto at: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/ - ...and install

# Getting started with Quarto in RStudio

-   once Quarto is installed, it'll be an option when you create a new document
-   enter title (and author)
-   lots of output options to choose from
-   can set theme and options like table of contents straight away (but this can also be changed/added later)

## The same as in R Markdown

-   a lot of the YAML (sometimes, R Markdown uses an underscore where Quarto uses a hyphen)
-   text formatting options, e.g., headlines, bold and italics, lists
-   references (but Quarto automatically adds a headline that reads "References")
-   inserting pictures (but see layout options below)

## Different to R Markdown

### Labelling figures

In the code block in which a graph is created or called, you can add options such as labels (#\| label: ) and captions (#\| fig-cap: ) Both will be displayed underneath the graph.

Pictures can also get a label: {#fig-label}

The labels can be used for in-text references with @fig-label

### On slides: Code isn't shown by default

Use:

```{r}
#| echo: true
```

...in individual code blocks

Or: echo: true in the YAML

## New additions

### Arranging pictures

Pictures can still be inserted using: ![Caption](file.png)

Several pictures can be arranged more easily using layout-ncol or layout-nrow - for example: ::: {layout-ncol=2} ![Caption](file1.png) ![Caption](file2.png) :::

Custom layouts are also possible - more info: https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html

### Callout blocks

The five callout blocks: - note - tip - warning - caution - important

Callout blocks are framed by :::{callout-TypeOfCallout} and :::

More info: https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html

### Placing content in the margins

To put footnotes and references in the margins of the document instead of at the bottom, we can add the following lines to the YAML: reference-location: margin citation-location: margin

You can also add asides in the margins: [This is an aside, text that will be displayed in the margin.]{.aside}

Figure captions can also be placed in the margin:

```{r}
#| cap-location: margin
```

# Other output formats

Like R Markdown documents, Quarto documents can be rendered to Word and PDF

For output formats such as Word and PDFs, page breaks can be added using: {{< pagebreak >}}
